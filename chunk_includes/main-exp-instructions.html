style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS",sans-serif'> In this study you will hear different
                sentences over your headphones in Korean. Your job is to listen to the sentence and decide what word you heard 
        at the beginning of the sentence. </p>
        <p>
            On each trial, you will first hear a sentence paired with a blank screen. After the audio finishes playing, you will then see two words 
            appear on the screen on the left and right. <strong>Once you see these words</strong>, you must 
            give a response by pressing the "F" key with your left index finger if you heard the word on the left or the "J" 
            key with your right index finger if you heard the word on the right. 
        </p>

    In this study, we will measure both SPEED and CORRECTNESS, so please press the correct key when the words appear on the screen 
    as soon as you are sure of your answer. You will only have a short period to respond before the next sentence plays automatically, so please respond quickly as accurately as you can.

    The whole study will last about 25-30 minutes with two breaks and a final questionnaire. You will first complete a short practice session before the main study begins.

<p style="text-align:left"><span
style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS",sans-serif'>When ready to start the PRACTICE SESSION, press number 3.</span></p>
