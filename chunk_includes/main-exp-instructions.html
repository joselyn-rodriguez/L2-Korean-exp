style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS",sans-serif'> In this study you will hear different
                sentences over your headphones in Korean. Your job is to listen to the sentence and decide what sound you heard 
        in the sentence. </p>
        <p>
            On each trial, you will first hear a sentence playing while the screen is blank. After the sentences finishes playing, you will be asked what sound you heard in the first word of the sentence. 
            Two options will appear on the screen on the left and right. <strong>Once you see these appear</strong>, you must 
            give a response by pressing the "F" key with your left index finger if you heard the sound on the left or the "J" 
            key with your right index finger if you heard the sound on the right. 
            
        </p> 
        <p>
            Sometimes it may be hard to tell what sound you heard, but you must give a response even if you're uncertain.

    In this study, we will measure both SPEED and CORRECTNESS, so please press the correct key when the words appear on the screen 
    as soon as you are sure of your answer. You will only have a short period to respond before the next sentence plays automatically, so please respond quickly as accurately as you can.
    
    </p>

    The whole study will last about 25-30 minutes with two breaks and a final questionnaire. You will first complete a short practice session before the experiment begins.

<p style="text-align:left"><span
style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS",sans-serif'>When ready to start the PRACTICE SESSION, press number 3.</span></p>
