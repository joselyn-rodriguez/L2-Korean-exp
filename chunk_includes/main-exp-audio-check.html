       Once again, please calibrate your audio level for the check by playing the following sound and setting your volume. First, set your computer volume to about 25% of maximum.
       Press the button, then turn up the volume on your computer until the calibration noise is at a loud but comfortable level.
       Play the calibration sound as many times as you like. Once you are done setting your audio, please do not change the audio level!
